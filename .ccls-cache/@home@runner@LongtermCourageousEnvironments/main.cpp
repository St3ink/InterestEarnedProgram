Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a savings account after one year may be calculated as:
Amount = Principal x (1+ (Rate/T)^T) 
Principal is the balance in the savings account, Rate is the interest rate, and T is the number of times the interest is compounded during a year (T is 4 if the interest is compounded quarterly). Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times the interest is compounded.
